                      <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">PopPUNK</code> is a tool for clustering genomes. We refer to the clusters as variable-length-k-mer clusters, or VLKCs.
                        Biologically, these clusters typically represent distinct strains. We refer to subclusters of strains as lineages.</p>

                      <p>The first version was targeted specifically as bacterial genomes, but the current version has also been used for viruses
                        (e.g. enterovirus, influenza, SARS-CoV-2) and eukaryotes (e.g. <em>Candida sp.</em>, <em>P. falciparum</em>).</p>

                      <p>Under the hood, PopPUNK uses <a href="https://github.com/johnlees/pp-sketchlib" target="_blank">pp-sketchlib</a> to rapidly
                        calculate core and accessory distances, and machine learning tools written in python to use these to cluster genomes.
                        A detailed description of the method can be found in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.241455.118">paper</a>.

                      <p>If you are new to PopPUNK, weâ€™d recommend starting reading the <a href="https://poppunk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practises.html" target="_blank">best practises guide</a>.

                        <p>As well as the 'core' tool of PopPUNK for genomic epidemiology, the following related packages are also available</p>

                          <li><a href="https://github.com/johnlees/pp-sketchlib" target="_blank">pp-sketchlib</a>
                            (installed as <code class="highlighter-rouge">poppunk_sketch</code>) is a high performance genomes
                            sketching library developed specifically for PopPUNK. It can rapidly calculate pairwise core and accessory
                            distances between long genomes, and makes use of multiple CPUs or even GPUs. It can also be used standalone
                            as a drop-in replacement for mash, and supports faster queries, uses smaller databases on disk, and a wider
                            range of sequence types.</li>
                          <li><a href="https://github.com/johnlees/poppipe" target="_blank">PopPIPE</a> is a pipeline which automates
                            some common downstream analyses on strains defined by PopPUNK. It produces subclusters, maximum likelihood trees
                            and associated visualisations using a computationally efficient approach.</li>
